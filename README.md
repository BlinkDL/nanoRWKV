![NanoRWKV Loss Training](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlinkDL/nanoRWKV/master/assets/nanoRWKV-loss.png)

A simplified NanoGPT - Like Repo to show that RNNs can compete with GPT. This is RWKV "x051a" which does not require custom CUDA kernel to train, so it works for any GPU / CPU. A rewrite of the RWKV LLM created by Peng Bo, and sponsored by Stability and Eleuther AI. Help to create would be appreciated üôÇ. For more information, visit the [RWKV GitHub Repo](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM), or join the Discord.
